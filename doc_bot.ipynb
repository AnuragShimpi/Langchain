Another\\ncommon example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the\\nsky during thunderstor ms. W e also experience a sensation of an electric\\nshock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a\\nbus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is\\ndischarge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated\\ndue to rubbing of insulating sur faces. Y ou might have also hear d that\\nthis is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we\\nare going to discuss in this and the next chapter . Static means anything\\nthat does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with\\nthe study of forces, fields and potentials arising from\\nstatic charges .\\n1.2  E LECTRIC  CHARGE\\nHistorically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with\\nwool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,\\naround 600 BC.

       "\" Quantisation is the process of assigning specific discrete numerical values to certain physical quantities, such as electric charge. In the context of electric charge, quantisation means that the total charge of a body is always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge, denoted as e. This property arises from the nature of electromagnetic particles, such as electrons and protons, which have inherent discrete amounts of charge.\\n\\nIn simpler terms, quantisation implies that electric charge cannot be divided into smaller units indefinitely. It's similar to how money can only be divided into discrete amounts, such as pennies or cents, and you can't have a fraction of a penny or cent. In the provided context, electrons and protons have charges +e and –e, respectively, and these charges are intrinsic to these particles and cannot be altered.\\n\\nThe concept of quantisation is not limited to electric charge alone but is also applicable to other physical quantities, such as energy levels in atoms and the spin of elementary particles. It is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles and systems at the microscopic level, spanning from atoms to subatomic particles. \""
